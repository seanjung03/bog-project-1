          Casey Luong, known mononymously by his stage name Keshi, is an
          American singer, songwriter, record producer, and
          multi-instrumentalist. Known for his distant falsetto vocals and
          textural instrumentals, he has accumulated over one billion streams
          with songs such as "Like I Need U", "2 Soon" and "Right Here".

          Early life: Luong was born in Houston, Texas, to Vietnamese parents
          and grew up in Sugar Land. Despite living in an ethnically diverse
          community with a large Asian population, he recalls that he often felt
          out of place and disconnected from his heritage while growing up, as
          others around him were mostly ethnically Chinese. When he was 13, he
          began learning the guitar after picking it up from his grandfather. He
          began teaching himself the instrument while using his grandfather's
          Vietnamese music book. Another one of his motivations for learning
          guitar came from watching Drake Bell on the Nickelodeon TV show Drake
          & Josh. He cites John Mayer and Ed Sheeran as his biggest influences
          as a kid.

          Career: He created the moniker "Keshi" and began to share music via
          his SoundCloud page around 2017. He credited watching YouTube
          tutorials for teaching him how to write, produce, and engineer his
          music. Initially, he was in doubt of his abilities and musical
          direction, but slowly his distinct style, which relies on his dreamy
          vocals combined with lo-fi beats and guitar, garnered more attention
          and popularity. In 2019, he quit his job as a nurse and flew to New
          York City to sign with Island Records. His decision to quit nursing
          and the pursuit of music was ultimately made due to his realization
          that the fear of missed opportunities exceeded his fear of failure.
          From there, his first singles attracted millions of listeners upon
          release.
